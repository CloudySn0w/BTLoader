***The Future Of BoundTweak***

BoundTweak was never meant to be **just** Revenge. It was meant to be a shot at *redemption*.
Now that we're free I'm absolutely open for suggestions regarding this project. Please do contact me on discord. You can find me at various spaces but Unbound and Kettu is where I am most connected to all this.

I feel as though some honorable mentions are needed here because without them I would've never made this work. 
Firstly we have github user [Cristiandis](https://github.com/Cristiandis) which I doubt we'd be here right now without their help. Especially with the buildscript which taught me a lot.
Secondly and also last we have the awesome community on the Revenge discord server which helped me from the absolute start of all this with working around the bad code Castdrian had added.

Thank you all for being here and reading this <3
