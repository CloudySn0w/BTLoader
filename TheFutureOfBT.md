***The Future Of BoundTweak***

BoundTweak was never meant to be **just** Revenge. It was meant to be a shot at redemption.
Now that we're free I'm absolutely open for suggestions regarding this project. There has admittedly been some talks with PalmDevs regarding the possibility of expanding this loader to work with Revenge Next.
I want to make it very VERY clear that I know barely ANY coding whatsoever. So if you want to help this along your always welcome to talk to me on the [**Revenge discord server.**](https://discord.com/invite/ddcQf3s2Uq)

I feel as though some honorable mentions are needed here because without them I would've never made this work. 
Firstly we have github user [Cristiandis](https://github.com/Cristiandis) which I doubt we'd be here right now without their help. Especially with the buildscript which taught me a lot.
Secondly and also last we have the awesome community on the Revenge discord server which helped me from the absolute start of all this.

Thank you all for being here and reading this <3
