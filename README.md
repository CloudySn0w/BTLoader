The Castdrian Story.

When BunnyTweak’s new maintainer, GitHub user Castdrian, took the reins of the Bunny loader for iOS named BunnyTweak, the community expected fresh features and transparent stewardship. Instead, what unfolded was a cascade of questionable maneuvers—each more alarming than the last:

1. Unauthorized License Hijack: Under the guise of “clarifying usage,” Castdrian grafted onto the repository a heavily “customized” OSS license that no open-source authority recognizes. By unilaterally appending retroactive restrictions, he tried to force every downstream user to jump through arbitrary legal hoops—an outright violation of standard licensing norms.

2. Malicious Pop-Up Insertion: Mid-update to what seemed like normal patches, he slipped in a hidden snippet that triggered a persistent “Disabled Third-Party Bundles” pop-up which only triggered when Revenge was set to load. This wasn’t a benign reminder—it actively broke communities and left countless users scrambling to rollback or patch the code. Many suspected it was a power-play to stifle competition and cement his tight already tight grip on the discord mod ecosystem through the loader.

3. Community Intimidation Tactics: Many users who dared question the changes of the OSS license were met with terse “take it or leave it” responses, or outright dismissed.

4. Legal Overreach: With no legal standing, Castdrian threatened potential forkers with “breach of license” notices. He claimed rights over code that was open source and dismissed any critique and forks as “unauthorized modification.” It was a bluff—but one that succeeded in muzzling many would-be collaborators.

***Why BoundTweak Exists***

Faced with these underhanded tactics, the community needed a safe harbor. BoundTweak was born to:

  Restore the true OSL 3.0: No hidden amendments, no surprise obligations.

  Re-enable 3rd party bundles: We’ve reworked the code and re-enabled Revenge’s bundle alongside DiscordNoTrack and a working OpenInDiscord for the loader.

  Stand up to license fear-mongering: We follow the letter of OSL 3.0—open, fair, irrevocable.

*A New Chapter for iOS Discord Mods*

I was silenced once—locked out of discussions and frozen by legal threats. Today, I stand stronger. BoundTweak is the last actively maintained iOS Discord mod that champions genuine open-source values. Pylix, your leadership in finally severing ties with Castdrian’s regime was the spark—thank you for not giving in and accepting his illicit activities.

Dive in, make it yours, and let’s build something unbreakable together.
