# ðŸ’§ BTLoader

Tweak to inject [Ra1n](https://github.com/ra1ncord/ra1n) into Discord and perform various tasks.

**We at BTLoader wish to clarify that while BTLoader is intended to load Ra1n upon its release, this functionality is not yet available. Consequently, BTLoader currently loads the Revenge Bundle.**

## Installation

The latest builds can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/CloudySn0w/BTLoader/releases) tab.
