# Welcome To BoundTweak

The Castdrian Story.

When BunnyTweak’s new maintainer, GitHub user Castdrian, took the reins, the community expected fresh features and transparent stewardship. Instead, what unfolded was a cascade of questionable maneuvers—each more alarming than the last:

1. Unauthorized License Hijack
Under the guise of “clarifying usage,” Castdrian grafted onto the repository a heavily “customized” OSS license that no open-source authority recognizes. By unilaterally appending retroactive restrictions, he tried to force every downstream user to jump through arbitrary legal hoops—an outright violation of standard licensing norms.

2. Malicious Pop-Up Insertion
Mid-update, he slipped in a hidden snippet that triggered a persistent “Disabled Third-Party Bundles” pop-up. This wasn’t a benign reminder—it actively broke communities and left countless users scrambling to rollback or patch the code. Many suspected it was a power-play to stifle competition and cement his tight already quite tight grip on the mod ecosystem.

3. Community Intimidation Tactics
Users who dared question the changes were met with terse “take it or leave it” responses, or outright dismissed.

4. Legal Bluster Overreach
With no legal standing, Castdrian threatened potential forkers with “breach of license” notices. He claimed patent rights over routine refactors and dismissed any critique as “unauthorized modification.” It was a bluff—but one that succeeded in muzzling many would-be collaborators.

***Why BoundTweak Exists***

Faced with these underhanded tactics, the community needed a safe harbor. BoundTweak was born to:

  Restore true OSL 3.0: No hidden amendments, no surprise obligations.

  Re-enable 3rd party bundles: We’ve re-woven Revenge’s bundle alongside DiscordNoTrack and a working OpenInDiscord—without freezes, without pop-ups.

  Stand up to license fear-mongering: We follow the letter of OSL 3.0—open, fair, irrevocable.

*A New Chapter for iOS Discord Mods*

I was silenced once—locked out of discussions and frozen by legal threats. Today, I stand stronger. BoundTweak is the last actively maintained iOS Discord mod that champions genuine open-source values. Pylix, your leadership in finally severing ties with Castdrian’s regime was the spark—thank you for cutting through the darkness.

Dive in, make it yours, and let’s build something unbreakable together.
